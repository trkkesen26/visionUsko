This repo is used for learning something that is with funny way I think. So I started this project and I have got a lot of things that I want to do.

Right now, we can use some of skills in the game(Knight Online):
* Repair items if you have in your inventory.
* Use Mp and Hp potions if character needs.
* Feed pet.
* Atack with only one skill. 
* Use wolf and defense skills.

In my project I got a aim that I want to finish this project with all skills and some human actings. Also I want to built a GUI for using simple.
